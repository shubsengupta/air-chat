# AirChat - a real-time, sentiment based chat for YouTube Live

Airchat lets users chat on livestreams and provides real-time sentiment analysis to show how all the viewers are feeling as the event goes on. We also implemented a mobile interface to bring physical event attendees in the same conversation as online viewers. 

We used firebase to handle all our server-side data with a minimal back-end, using node js and express to compliment it. The sentiment analysis was completed by sending an asynchronous request to Indico's machine learning API. We then show a visual 'heatmap' of sentiment using pure javascript visual elements.


### This project was built in one weekend at Hack the North 2015
